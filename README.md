# Presidential-Height-Data-Analysis

In this project I sourced the data from kaagle which I tend analyzed to see if I had what it takes, height, to be president. The average height is ~183 cm sadly I can't become president, unless ofcourse should I decide to walk everywhere on my tippie toes. This project was fun as it sharpened my blade in doing statistics with python and refreshing as I got to revist my statistics courses from University, for a brief moment I felt like an undergraduate student.
